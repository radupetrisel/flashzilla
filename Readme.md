# Flashzilla

This is project 17 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/flashzilla-introduction)). This is an app that helps users learn things using flashcards – cards with one thing written on such as “to buy”, and another thing written on the other side, such as “comprar”.

As usual, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges for me to solve on my own.

## Challenges

**Challenge #1**: When adding a card, the textfields keep their current text – fix that so that the textfields clear themselves after a card is added.
